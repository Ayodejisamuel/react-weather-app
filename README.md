## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your GitHub Repository URL]
    cd react-weather-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key:**
    * Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
    * Once logged in, go to the "API keys" tab to get your API key.

4.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root directory of your project, create a file named `.env` and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
    ```
    REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=[Your OpenWeatherMap API Key Here]
    ```
    **Important:** Do not commit your `.env` file to version control (e.g., GitHub). It's already ignored by `.gitignore` in typical Create React App setups.

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
